Introduction
Learning Python can be an exciting journey, and this repository serves as my personal progress tracker as I explore various Python concepts. The code samples provided here are meant to showcase my understanding and growth throughout my learning journey.

#Folder Structure
The repository is organized into weekly folders, with each folder representing a specific week of learning.

#How to Use
Feel free to explore the folders and code files based on the topics you are interested in. You can access each week's code to learn and understand the concepts better. If you have any questions or suggestions, you can create an issue, and I'll be happy to help.

#Contributing
As this repository primarily serves as a personal learning tracker, I am not actively seeking contributions. However, if you spot any issues or have valuable insights, I welcome your feedback and suggestions through the issue tracker.
